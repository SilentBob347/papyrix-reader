# EInkDisplay

EInkDisplay provides controller access for Xteink X3, X4, and X4 Pro.
`papyrix::hal::Display` selects the driver from the active hardware profile.
`GfxRenderer` provides text, image, shape, and orientation handling.

## Frame Buffers

`getFrameBuffer()` returns the active frame buffer.
A zero bit represents black.
A one bit represents white.
Use the active profile dimensions for all buffer access.

`displayBuffer()` sends a black-and-white frame.
The controller driver implements full, half, and fast refresh requests.
The grayscale methods send the two bit planes and apply the controller waveform.
See the [rendering pipeline](../../docs/rendering-pipeline.md).

## Power

Call `deepSleep()` before device sleep.
The driver completes the controller power-off sequence before deep sleep.
Do not remove panel power during a refresh.
